    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[Sensitive Data Protection](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/sensitive-data-protection) is a fully managed service designed to discover, classify, and protect your sensitive data wherever it resides. It uses a variety of methods to identify sensitive data including regular expressions, dictionaries, and contextual elements. Once sensitive data is identified, Sensitive Data Protection (Cloud Data Loss Prevention) can take several actions to either classify, mask, encrypt, or even delete it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitive Data Protection can be accessed via Google Cloud console and used to scan data within Cloud Storage, BigQuery and other Google Cloud services. The following notebook demonstrates using the [Python Client for Cloud Data Loss Prevention](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/dlp/latest) to incorporate Sensitive Data Protection capabilities directly with Generative AI enabled applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this Python client, you define custom functions that can identify and take corrective action on sensitive data within Large Language Models (LLM) responses in real time. Throughout this notebook, you generate example text with sensitive data and run the results through custom Python functions that redact the sensitive data from Gemini 2.0 Flash model responses, so you can see this functionality in action on example data. \n",
    "\n",
    "After learning how to work with the Python client, you can adapt these same Python functions for Gen AI applications in your organization to protect sensitive data across your workflows.  \n",

       "\n",
       "**Explanation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **`public class HelloWorld { ... }`**:  This defines a class named `HelloWorld`.  In Java, all code must reside within a class.  The `public` keyword means this class is accessible from anywhere.\n",
       "* **`public static void main(String[] args) { ... }`**: This is the `main` method.  It's the entry point of the program.  When you run the Java program, the code inside the `main` method is executed first.\n",
       "    * `public static`:  `public` means it's accessible from anywhere. `static` means you don't need to create an object of the `HelloWorld` class to call this method.\n",
       "    * `void`:  This means the method doesn't return any value.\n",
       "    * `String[] args`: This is an array of strings that can be used to pass arguments to the program from the command line.\n",
       "* **`// This is a comment`**:  Comments are used to explain the code.  The compiler ignores them.  `//` indicates a single-line comment.  `/* ... */` indicates a multi-line comment.\n",
       "* **`System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");`**: This line prints the text \"Hello, World!\" to the console (the standard output).\n",
       "    * `System.out` is an object that represents the standard output stream.\n",
       "    * `println()` is a method of the `System.out` object that prints a line of text.\n",
       "* **`String message = \"This is a message stored in a variable.\";`**: This declares a variable named `message` of type `String` and assigns it the value \"This is a message stored in a variable.\".\n",
       "    * `String` is a data type that represents a sequence of characters (text).\n",
       "* **`int number1 = 10;`**: This declares a variable named `number1` of type `int` (integer) and assigns it the value 10.\n",
       "* **`int sum = number1 + number2;`**: This calculates the sum of `number1` and `number2` and stores the result in a variable named `sum`.\n",
       "* **`if (sum > 12) { ... } else { ... }`**: This is an `if-else` statement.  It checks if the condition `sum > 12` is true.  If it is, the code inside the `if` block is executed.  Otherwise, the code inside the `else` block is executed.\n",
       "* **`for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) { ... }`**: This is a `for` loop.  It executes the code inside the loop repeatedly.\n",
       "    * `int i = 1`:  Initializes a loop counter variable `i` to 1.\n",
       "    * `i <= 5`:  The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 5.\n",
       "    * `i++`:  Increments `i` by 1 after each iteration of the loop.\n",
       "* **`printGreeting(\"Alice\");`**: This calls the `printGreeting` method, passing the string \"Alice\" as an argument.\n",
       "* **`public static void printGreeting(String name) { ... }`**: This defines a method named `printGreeting` that takes a `String` argument named `name`.  The method prints a greeting to the console, including the name.\n",
       "\n",
       "**How to Compile and Run:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Save the code:** Save the code in a file named `HelloWorld.java`.  Make sure the filename matches the class name (including capitalization).\n",
       "2. **Compile:** Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.  Then, compile the code using the Java compiler:\n",
       "   ```bash\n",
       "   javac HelloWorld.java\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "   This will create a file named `HelloWorld.class` (the compiled bytecode).\n",
       "3. **Run:** Run the compiled code using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM):\n",
       "   ```bash\n",
       "   java HelloWorld\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "   This will execute the `main` method and print the output to the console.\n",
       "\n",
       "You should see the following output:\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "This patent, granted to Apple Inc., generally describes a method and apparatus for providing a user interface on a mobile device (like a smartphone or tablet) that allows users to easily access and interact with applications and other functions.  Specifically, it focuses on:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **A Dock:**  A persistent area (often at the bottom of the screen) that displays frequently used applications or functions.  This dock remains visible even when other applications are running.\n",
       "*   **Application Icons:**  Graphical representations of applications that can be selected to launch those applications.\n",
       "*   **User Interface Elements:**  The overall design and arrangement of elements on the screen to make it easy for users to navigate and use the device.\n",
       "*   **Gestures:** The patent also touches on using gestures to interact with the user interface.\n",

       "*   **Abstract:** A brief summary of the invention.  Read this first to get a general idea.\n",
       "*   **Background:**  Describes the problem the invention is trying to solve and the existing technology (prior art) that it builds upon.\n",
       "*   **Summary:**  A more detailed overview of the invention.\n",
       "*   **Drawings:**  Visual representations of the invention.  These are often crucial for understanding how it works.\n",
       "*   **Detailed Description:**  The most comprehensive explanation of the invention, including how it's made and how it works.  This section often refers to the drawings.\n",
       "*   **Claims:**  The most important part of the patent.  These are the *legal* definitions of what the patent protects.  They define the scope of the invention.  If someone else makes, uses, or sells something that falls within the scope of the claims, they could be infringing the patent.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why This Example is Useful:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Relatively Understandable:**  The concept of a dock and application icons is familiar to most people who use smartphones or tablets.\n",
       "*   **Real-World Application:**  It's a patent that has had a significant impact on the design of mobile device user interfaces.\n",
       "*   **Illustrative of Patent Structure:**  It demonstrates the typical sections and language used in a patent document.\n",
       "\n",
       "**How to Read the Patent (Tips):**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Start with the Abstract and Drawings:**  Get a general overview.\n",
       "2.  **Read the Background:**  Understand the problem the invention is addressing.\n",
       "3.  **Skim the Detailed Description:**  Focus on the parts that seem most relevant to the drawings.\n",
       "4.  **Carefully Read the Claims:**  This is the most important part for understanding the legal scope of the patent.  Pay attention to the specific wording.  Claims often use terms like \"comprising,\" \"including,\" and \"consisting of,\" which have specific legal meanings.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Important Note:**  I am not a patent attorney, and this information is for educational purposes only.  If you have specific legal questions about patents, you should consult with a qualified patent attorney.  Analyzing patents and determining infringement is a complex legal process.\n",
