    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[Sensitive Data Protection](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/sensitive-data-protection) is a fully managed service designed to discover, classify, and protect your sensitive data wherever it resides. It uses a variety of methods to identify sensitive data including regular expressions, dictionaries, and contextual elements. Once sensitive data is identified, Sensitive Data Protection (Cloud Data Loss Prevention) can take several actions to either classify, mask, encrypt, or even delete it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitive Data Protection can be accessed via Google Cloud console and used to scan data within Cloud Storage, BigQuery and other Google Cloud services. The following notebook demonstrates using the [Python Client for Cloud Data Loss Prevention](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/dlp/latest) to incorporate Sensitive Data Protection capabilities directly with Generative AI enabled applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this Python client, you define custom functions that can identify and take corrective action on sensitive data within Large Language Models (LLM) responses in real time. Throughout this notebook, you generate example text with sensitive data and run the results through custom Python functions that redact the sensitive data from Gemini 1.5 Pro model responses, so you can see this functionality in action on example data. \n",
    "\n",
    "After learning how to work with the Python client, you can adapt these same Python functions for Gen AI applications in your organization to protect sensitive data across your workflows.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- Installing the Python packages for Vertex AI and Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API\n",
    "- Generating examples with sensitive data using Gemini 1.5 Pro model\n",
    "- Defining and running Python functions to redact different types of sensitive data in Gemini 1.5 Pro model responses using the DLP API"
