It powers the chatbot of the same name.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Development ===\\n\\nGoogle announced Gemini, a large language model (LLM) developed by subsidiary Google DeepMind, during the Google I/O keynote on May 10, 2023. It was positioned as a more powerful successor to PaLM 2, which was also unveiled at the event, with Google CEO Sundar Pichai stating that Gemini was still in its early developmental stages. Unlike other LLMs, Gemini was said to be unique in that it was not trained on a text corpus alone and was designed to be multimodal, meaning it could process multiple types of data simultaneously, including text, images, audio, video, and computer code. It had been developed as a collaboration between DeepMind and Google Brain, two branches of Google that had been merged as Google DeepMind the previous month. In an interview with Wired, DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis touted Gemini\\'s advanced capabilities, which he believed would allow the algorithm to trump OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT, which runs on GPT-4 and whose growing popularity had been aggressively challenged by Google with LaMDA and Bard. Hassabis highlighted the strengths of DeepMind\\'s AlphaGo program, which gained worldwide attention in 2016 when it defeated Go champion Lee Sedol, saying that Gemini would combine the power of AlphaGo and other Google–DeepMind LLMs.\\nIn August 2023, The Information published a report outlining Google\\'s roadmap for Gemini, revealing that the company was targeting a launch date of late 2023. According to the report, Google hoped to surpass OpenAI and other competitors by combining conversational text capabilities present in most LLMs with artificial intelligence–powered image generation, allowing it to create contextual images and be adapted for a wider range of use cases. Like Bard, Google co-founder Sergey Brin was summoned out of retirement to assist in the development of Gemini, along with hundreds of other engineers from Google Brain and DeepMind; he was later credited as a \"core contributor\" to Gemini. Because Gemini was being trained on transcripts of YouTube videos, lawyers were brought in to filter out any potentially copyrighted materials.\\nWith news of Gemini\\'s impending launch, OpenAI hastened its work on integrating GPT-4 with multimodal features similar to those of Gemini. The Information reported in September that several companies had been granted early access to \"an early version\" of the LLM, which Google intended to make available to clients through Google Cloud\\'s Vertex AI service. The publication also stated that Google was arming Gemini to compete with both GPT-4 and Microsoft\\'s GitHub Copilot.\\n\\n\\n=== Launch ===\\nOn December 6, 2023, Pichai and Hassabis announced \"Gemini 1.0\" at a virtual press conference. It comprised three models: Gemini Ultra, designed for \"highly complex tasks\"; Gemini Pro, designed for \"a wide range of tasks\"; and Gemini Nano, designed for \"on-device tasks\". At launch, Gemini Pro and Nano were integrated into Bard and the Pixel 8 Pro smartphone, respectively, while Gemini Ultra was set to power \"Bard Advanced\" and become available to software developers in early 2024. Other products that Google intended to incorporate Gemini into included Search, Ads, Chrome, Duet AI on Google Workspace, and AlphaCode 2. It was made available only in English. Touted as Google\\'s \"largest and most capable AI model\" and designed to emulate human behavior, the company stated that Gemini would not be made widely available until the following year due to the need for \"extensive safety testing\". Gemini was trained on and powered by Google\\'s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and the name is in reference to the DeepMind–Google Brain merger as well as'),\n",

It became the center of controversy in February 2024, when social media users reported that it was generating historically inaccurate images of historical figures as people of color, with conservative commentators decrying its alleged bias as \"wokeness\".\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\n\\nIn November 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a chatbot based on the GPT-3 family of large language models (LLMs). ChatGPT gained worldwide attention following its release, becoming a viral Internet sensation. Alarmed by ChatGPT\\'s potential threat to Google Search, Google executives issued a \"code red\" alert, reassigning several teams to assist in the company\\'s artificial intelligence (AI) efforts. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and parent company Alphabet, was widely reported to have issued the alert, but Pichai later denied this to The New York Times. In a rare move, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who had stepped down from their roles as co-CEOs of Alphabet in 2019, were summoned to emergency meetings with company executives to discuss Google\\'s response to ChatGPT. Brin requested access to Google\\'s code in February 2023, for the first time in years.\\nEarlier in 2021, the company had unveiled LaMDA, a prototype LLM, but did not release it to the public. When asked by employees at an all-hands meeting whether LaMDA was a missed opportunity for Google to compete with ChatGPT, Pichai and Google AI chief Jeff Dean stated that while the company had similar capabilities to ChatGPT, moving too quickly in that arena would represent a major \"reputational risk\" due to Google being substantially larger than OpenAI. In January 2023, Google sister company DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis hinted at plans for a ChatGPT rival, and Google employees were instructed to accelerate progress on a ChatGPT competitor, intensively testing \"Apprentice Bard\" and other chatbots. Pichai assured investors during Google\\'s quarterly earnings investor call in February that the company had plans to expand LaMDA\\'s availability and applications.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Announcement ===\\nOn February 6, 2023, Google announced Bard, a generative artificial intelligence chatbot powered by LaMDA. Bard was first rolled out to a select group of 10,000 \"trusted testers\", before a wide release scheduled at the end of the month. The project was overseen by product lead Jack Krawczyk, who described the product as a \"collaborative AI service\" rather than a search engine, while Pichai detailed how Bard would be integrated into Google Search. Reuters calculated that adding ChatGPT-like features to Google Search could cost the company $6 billion in additional expenses by 2024, while research and consulting firm SemiAnalysis calculated that it would cost Google $3 billion. The technology was developed under the code'),\n",

In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved then-SOTA perplexity. In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets (\"web as corpus\"), upon which they trained statistical language models. In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models, as they can usefully ingest large datasets.\\n\\nAfter neural networks became dominant in image processing around 2012, they were applied to language modelling as well. Google converted its translation service to Neural Machine Translation in 2016. As it was before Transformers, it was done by seq2seq deep LSTM networks.\\nAt the 2017 NeurIPS conference, Google researchers introduced the transformer architecture in their landmark paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". This paper\\'s goal was to improve upon 2014 Seq2seq technology, and was based mainly on the attention mechanism developed by Bahdanau et al. in 2014. The following year in 2018, BERT was introduced and quickly became \"ubiquitous\". Though the original transformer has both encoder and decoder blocks, BERT is an encoder-only model.\\nAlthough decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use.

ChatGPT gained worldwide attention following its release, becoming a viral Internet sensation. On January 23, 2023, Microsoft announced a multi-year US$10 billion investment in OpenAI. On February 6, Google announced Bard (later rebranded as Gemini), a ChatGPT-like chatbot service, fearing that ChatGPT could threaten Google\\'s place as a go-to source for information.

A chatbot feature, at the time known as Bing Chat, had been developed by Microsoft and was released in Bing and Edge as part of this overhaul. According to Microsoft, one million people joined its waitlist within a span of 48 hours. Bing Chat was available only to users of Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app, and Microsoft claimed that waitlisted users would be prioritized if they set Edge and Bing as their defaults, and installed the Bing mobile app. \\nWhen Microsoft demoed Bing Chat to journalists, it produced several hallucinations, including when asked to summarize financial reports. The new Bing was criticized in February 2023 for being more argumentative than ChatGPT, sometimes to an unintentionally humorous extent. The chat interface proved vulnerable to prompt injection attacks with the bot revealing its hidden initial prompts and rules, including its internal codename \"Sydney\". Upon scrutiny by journalists, Bing Chat claimed it spied on Microsoft employees via laptop webcams and phones. It confessed to spying on, falling in love with, and then murdering one of its developers at Microsoft to The Verge reviews editor Nathan Edwards. The New York Times journal'),\n",

It was originally used as a form of semi-supervised learning, as the model is trained first on an unlabelled dataset (pretraining step) by learning to generate datapoints in the dataset, and then it is trained to classify a labelled dataset.\\nWhile the unnormalized linear transformer dates back to 1992, the modern transformer architecture was not available until 2017 when it was published by researchers at Google in a paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". That development led to the emergence of large language models such as BERT in 2018 which was a pre-trained transformer (PT) but not designed to be generative (BERT was an \"encoder-only\" model). Also around that time, in 2018, OpenAI published its article entitled \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training\", in which it introduced the first generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) system (\"GPT-1\").\\nPrior to transformer-based architectures, the best-performing neural NLP (natural language processing) models commonly employed supervised learning from large amounts of manually-labeled data. The reliance on supervised learning limited their use on datasets that were not well-annotated, and also made it prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to train extremely large language models.\\nThe semi-supervised approach OpenAI employed to make a large-scale generative system—and was first to do with a transformer model—involved two stages: an unsupervised generative \"pretraining\" stage to set initial parameters using a language modeling objective, and a supervised discriminative \"fine-tuning\" stage to adapt these parameters to a target task.\\n\\n\\n=== Later developments ===\\nRegarding more recent GPT foundation models, OpenAI published its first versions of GPT-3 in July 2020. There were three models, with 1B, 6.7B, 175B parameters, respectively named babbage, curie, and davinci (giving initials B, C, and D).\\nIn July 2021, OpenAI published Codex, a task-specific GPT model targeted for programming applications. This was developed by fine-tuning a 12B parameter version of GPT-3 (different from previous GPT-3 models) using code from GitHub.\\nIn March 2022, OpenAI published two versions of GPT-3 that were fine-tuned for instruction-following (instruction-tuned), named davinci-instruct-beta (175B) and text-davinci-001, and then started beta testing code-davinci-002. text-davinci-002 was instruction-tuned from code-davinci-002.'),\n",

In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant.

The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text. In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with over 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples. GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.\\nRumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.\\n\\n\\n== Capabilities ==\\nOpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\" They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively. Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input; this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams. It can now interact with users through spoken words and respond to images, allowing for more natural conversations and the ability to provide suggestions or answers based on photo uploads.\\nTo gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.\\nWhen instructed to do so, GPT-4 can interact with external interfaces. For example, the model could be instructed to enclose a query within <search></search> tags to perform a web search, the result of which would be inserted into the model\\'s prompt to allow it to form a response. This allows the model to perform tasks beyond its normal text-prediction capabilities, such as using APIs, generating images, and accessing and summarizing webpages.\\nA 2023 article in Nature stated programmers have found GPT-4 useful for assisting in coding tasks (despite its propensity for error), such as finding errors in existing'),\n",

Developed within Huawei's MindSpore 5 framework, PanGu-Σ underwent training for over 100 days on a cluster system equipped with 512 Ascend 910 AI accelerator chips, processing 329 billion tokens in more than 40 natural and programming languages.\\nPanGu-Σ incorporates Random Routed Experts (RRE) and the Transformer decoder architecture, allowing easy extraction of sub-models for various applications like conversation, translation, code production, and natural language interpretation. The model achieves 6.3 times faster training throughput compared to MoE models with the same hyper-parameters. In the Chinese domain, it outperforms previous state-of-the-art models across 16 tasks in a zero-shot setting. Trained on datasets from 40 domains, including Chinese, English, Bilingual, and code, PanGu-Σ excels in few-shot natural-language understanding, open-domain discussion, question answering, machine translation, and code creation.\\n\\n\\n=== Launch ===\\nDuring the Huawei Developer Conference on July 7, 2023, Huawei introduced PanGu 3.0, a large language model (LLM), tailored for sectors like government, finance, manufacturing, mining, and meteorology utilizing Huawei Cloud solutions. In the subsequent month, Huawei launched the Celia Virtual Assistant with advanced AI features, capable of generating long text replies based on user voice commands and set to release with HarmonyOS 4.0 for eligible devices.\\nThe LLM was designed for enterprises seeking advantages in the AI industry, focusing on task execution over creative work, unlike traditional models used for general purposes like chatbots, poetry, and visual content creation.\\nUsing the same technology as ChatGPT, Huawei's LLM features a hierarchical architecture, allowing customers to adapt the model to various tasks and train it on their own datasets, making it versatile across various industries.\\n\\n\\n=== Updates ===\\nOn August 5, 2023, Huawei partnered with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) to launch a global weather forecasting AI model. This model used Huawei Cloud solutions and the PanGu-Weather Model with MindSpore. It is accessible on the ECMWF website and aims to provide accurate weather data.\\nOn December 19, 2023, Huawei announced its financial services on the PanGu-powered AI Finance platform for the global market. The tech giant introduced this product at the 2023 Huawei Cloud Fintech Summit, aiming to reshape the digital finance industry with efficient features to boost Fintech firms worldwide. The platform incorporated a variety of advanced technologies, including AI, big data analytics, and blockchain.\\nOn June 21, 2024, at HDC 2024, Huawei announced upgraded PanGu 5.0 alongside HarmonyOS NEXT. This version integrated with Harmony Intelligence, which features a smarter Celia (Xiaoyi) and focuses on generative AI updates to its LLM platform for creating new content, such as text, code, or images. Aiming to make PanGu accessible to a wide range of developers and businesses, it offered scalable options: smaller models requiring less computational power for those with limited resources, and larger models with increased capacities for complex tasks requiring more processing power.\\n\\n\\n== Technical specifications ==\\nPanGu Large Model 3.0, designed for industry use, was structured with a 5+N+X three-tier architecture.\\n\\nFirst Layer (L0): Comprises PanGu's five basic large\")]"
