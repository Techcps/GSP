    "Gemini 1.5 Pro, a member of Google's Gemini family, is a generative AI model purpose-built for diverse multimodal applications. It's proficiency in understanding and generating content across text, code, and images makes it a powerful asset for intricate codebase analysis. With its expansive 2M token context window, Gemini 1.5 Pro efficiently processes large code volumes in a single call, streamlining large-scale code scanning.Gemini 1.5 Pro's deep comprehension of programming languages and security best practices enables it to identify potential vulnerabilities and suggest helpful and contextual modifications. Learn more about [Gemini 1.5 Pro](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/pro/).\n",

    "\n",
    "This experimental approach aims to efficiently scan large codebases, analyze multiple files in a single call, and delve deeper into complex code relationships and patternsThe model's deep analysis of code can help ensure comprehensive vulnerability detection, going beyond surface-level flaws. By using this approach, we can accommodate code written in several programming languages. Additionally, we can generate the findings and recommendations as JSON or CSV reports, which we would hypothetically use to make comparisons against established benchmarks and policy checks. With this tutorial, you learn how to use the Gemini API in Vertex AI, Google Cloud Storage API and the Vertex AI SDK to work with the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to build a step by step code vulnerability scanning approach using Gemini 1.5 Pro with the following steps:\n",

    "*   Submit the consolidated code string to Gemini 1.5 Pro for analysis\n",
    "*   Extract vulnerability information, recommendations, and code snippets from the model response\n",

    "The scope of this experiment is limited to identifying issues and providing helpful and contextual modification. Automating remediations or fitting the findings into a review workflow would exist in a more mature tool, and hasn't been considered as part of the experiment. While Gemini 1.5 Pro demonstrates promising capabilities in code analysis, it's important to note that this approach is still experimental. We believe that it is important to explore the potential of this technology for vulnerability detection, and continue development and validation efforts before it can be considered a robust security tool"
