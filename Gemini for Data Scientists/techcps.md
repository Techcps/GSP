## 🚨 Check your progress on Task 1-2 then move forward to the next task

# 🚨Build the Python Notebook

## 🚨Query 1
```

## 🚨Query 2
## 🚨Set your Project I'd and Location Name

df = bpd.read_gbq(f"{project_id}.{dataset_name}.{table_name}")
df.head(10)
```

## 🚨Query 5
```
# prompt: 1. Split df into test and training data for a K-means clustering algorithm store these as df_test_ and df_train. 2. Create a K-means cluster model using bigframes.ml.cluster KMeans with 5 clusters. 3. Save the model to BigQuery in a model called ecommerce.model_name using the to_gbq method.

# 🚨 Now below query will take around 20-25 minutes to completed
> Just wait and watch & Make aure your laptop will not go for sleep

## 🚨Query 7
```
# prompt: 1. Using predictions_df, and matplotlib, generate a scatterplot. 2. On the x-axis of the scatterplot, display days_since_last_order and on the y-axis, display average_spend from predictions_df. 3. Color by cluster. The chart should be titled "Attribute grouped by K-means cluster."

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create the scatter plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(predictions_df['days_since_last_order'], predictions_df['average_spend'], c=predictions_df['CENTROID_ID'], cmap='viridis')

# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('Days Since Last Order')
plt.ylabel('Average Spend')
plt.title('Attribute grouped by K-means cluster')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
